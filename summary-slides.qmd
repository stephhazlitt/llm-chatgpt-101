## Domain Specific LLMs 👩‍💻

::: notes
Large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, can also be focused on domains, and tuned or targeted with additional information. These resulting models can have more expertise in a targeted domain – and avoid information which can produce confused output. Examples of these include those LLMs that are focused on code development, biomedical or legal domains (e.g., CodePilot, CodeLlama, BioBert, Legal-Bert).

## ChatGPT 👩‍💻

-   Generative: create something "new" (text)
-   Pre-training: Large Language Model (LLM) trained on a lot of data
-   Transformer: describes the design of this AI model
-   "Chat": trained on text & "conversational" data

> Developed by OpenAI, accessable via an easy to use browser-based user interface

## Who Is OpenAI? 👩‍💻

OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company.

> We are governed by a nonprofit and our unique capped-profit model drives our commitment to safety. This means that as AI becomes more powerful, we can redistribute profits from our work to maximize the social and economic benefits of AI technology.

<https://openai.com/about>

<br> [Note: It is reported that Microsoft’s investments in OpenAI give it a 49% stake in the company (billions of $)]{style="color:orange;"}

## ChatGPT 👩‍💻

- LLM model trained on ~45 terabytes of data, including all of Wikipedia, books, and webpages (up until Sept 2021)
-  \>100 million users in ~2 months, fastest-growing consumer software application _ever_
- ‘research preview’ is "free"---but nothing is really free, this allows OpenAI to assess the system’s strengths + weaknesses and gather feedback from early adopters

::: notes
Facebook took almost 5 years; Canva took 9 years; and Instagram needed 2.5 years to reach 100 million users. This was a feat achieved by ChatGPT in a mere 60 days or so
:::

## ChatGPT 👩‍💻

- training each model costs estimated to be ~$5 million dollars 🤯
- ChatGPT sits on Microsoft’s Azure Cloud infrastructure ($3/h single A100GPU super computer cluster)
- running costs estimated between $100,000 and $700,000 per day ($3-$21 million per month)
- OpenAI monetizing with ChatGPT Plus subscription (GPT-4 w/ 5x training parameters) for $20 per month fee

## ChatGPT the _UGLY_ 👩‍💻

- ethics (training data, use of outputs)
- bias (training data)
- data privacy
- "fake" information/data/news
- environmental footprint
- ...

## Prompt Engineering 👩‍💻

![](images/prompt-engineering.png){.absolute top="75"}

## Prompting Tips 🤖

![](images/prompt-tips.png)

## Prompting Tips 👩‍💻

- simple + short gets you started, but specificity gets much better results, e.g., style, tone, persona, length

- request the return format you want (e.g., csv/table, haiku, json file, slides)

- add the context ChatGPT does not know

## Zero-Shot Prompting 👩‍💻

- prompt without any examples or context (quick, simple, most common)

> Generate 5 possible names for my new blog website on data vizualizations

## One-Shot Prompting 👩‍💻

- prompt with a single example or piece of context provided by the user

> Generate 5 possible names for my new blog website on data vizualizations. A blog site name I like is Data is Beautiful. 

## Few-Shot Prompting 👩‍💻

- prompt with a few examples or pieces of context provided by the user

> Generate 5 possible names for my new blog website on data vizualizations. Blog site names I like include Data is Beautiful, Data Storytelling for Everyone and Data Doodling.

## Chain of Thought Prompting 👩‍💻

- a prompt that includes reasoning steps that mimics a train of thought (often ends with "Let's Think Step By Step")

> Farmer John had 93 chickens. If he sold 20 to Farmer Bill and bought twice that number more, how many chickens does Farmer John have now? Let’s think step by step.

## Self Criticism & Refine Prompting 👩‍💻

- prompt the LLM to assess its output for potential inaccuracies or improvement areas, and solve the problem again with this critique in-hand 

> Please re-read your above response. Do you see any issues or mistakes with your response? If so, please identify these issues or mistakes and make the necessary edits.
