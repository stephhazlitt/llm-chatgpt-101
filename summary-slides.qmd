## ChatGPT 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

- model trained for ~1-2 months on 45 terabytes of data, including all of Wikipedia, books, and webpages (up until Sept 2021)
-  more than 100 million users after only 2 months, fastest-growing consumer software application _ever_
- free, a ‘research preview’ which allows OpenAI to assess the system’s strengths + weaknesses and gather feedback from early adopters

::: notes
Facebook took almost 5 years; Canva took 9 years; and Instagram needed 2.5 years to reach 100 million users. This was a feat achieved by ChatGPT in a mere 60 days or so
