## ChatGPT 🤖

-   Generative: create something "new" (text)
-   Pre-training: Large Language Model (LLM) trained on a lot of data
-   Transformer: describes the design of this AI model
-   "Chat": trained on text & "conversational" data

## Who is OpenAI? 🪟

OpenAI is an AI research and deployment company.

> We are governed by a nonprofit and our unique capped-profit model drives our commitment to safety. This means that as AI becomes more powerful, we can redistribute profits from our work to maximize the social and economic benefits of AI technology.

## What is an LLM? 𝌭

<content>

## ChatGPT 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

- LLM model trained on ~45 terabytes of data, including all of Wikipedia, books, and webpages (up until Sept 2021)
-  \>100 million users in ~2 months, fastest-growing consumer software application _ever_
- ‘research preview’ is "free"---which allows OpenAI to assess the system’s strengths + weaknesses and gather feedback from early adopters

::: notes
Facebook took almost 5 years; Canva took 9 years; and Instagram needed 2.5 years to reach 100 million users. This was a feat achieved by ChatGPT in a mere 60 days or so
